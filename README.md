# Instructions

## Setup: Receiving updates

To be done once: add our project repo as an extra remote called `upstream`.

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications-bitcoin.git
```

To be done at each update:

```bash
$ git pull upstream master
```

To be notified of updates, register as watcher [here](https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications-bitcoin).

## Structure

There are 3 folders, one for each permanent evaluation (often referred to as PE). Every assignment folder has its own assignment description `.md` file. It is highly suggested that you read this before you start coding.

For the second exam chance, you'll have to make an extension. This will be added to the assignment folder where it is applicable to.
